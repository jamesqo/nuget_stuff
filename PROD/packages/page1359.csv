It features:
 * a full C# port of the libudis86 C library
 * a set of simple C# classes wrapping the udis86 API
 * support for x86 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit instruction set architectures
 * support for outputting in Intel and AT&T syntax
 * support for all x86 and x86-64 (AMD64) General purpose and System instructions.
 * support for the following ISA extensions:
   - MMX, FPU (x87), AMD 3DNow
   - SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AES,
   - AMD-V, INTEL-VMX, SMX
 * instructions are defined in an XML document that is consumed by a T4 template to generate opcode tables for performance.
 * the XML instructions document is exactly the same as that found within the udis86 project. The generated C# opcode tables is also very similar except in syntax to those generated by the Python script in the libudis86 C-library.
 * able to decode more than 4 million 64-bit instructions per second (with an average instruction size of 7-bytes)
