Features:

 - Fully integrated with NLog: it does not require changes in your application code beyond the configuration.

 - Self-hosted: it does not need IIS or any hosting framework, WebSocketListener is socket based.

 - Mono compatible: Both NLog and WebSocketListener are compatible with Mono.

 - Subscribe to Regular Expressions: Is it possible to send a message throug the WebSocket connection to indicate the expression to which you want to subscribe. Only log entries matching that regex will be sent.

 - Scalable: NLog and WebSocketListener components are decoupled by a producer-consumer pattern, so NLog will append the log entries to WebSocketServerTarget in O(1) time always, and another thread/threads are responsible of distributing that log entry to the clients. Still, if the component has a big number of connected clients, it may interfere with your application performance.
