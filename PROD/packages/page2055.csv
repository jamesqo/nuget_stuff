Besides the common features a HTML to PDF Converter must have, the HiQPdf component has some unique features on the market like the full support for web fonts, the ability to convert only a selected region of the HTML document or the possibility to overlap multiple HTML documents in the same PDF while preserving the transparent backgrounds and images from the HTML document.

The HiQPdf Library is much more than just a HTML to PDF converter. The HTML to PDF conversion engine is the most important feature, but the HiQPdf software is a complete PDF library for .NET that you can use to create new PDF documents and add text and images at the desired positions in pages in a traditional manner, open and edit external PDF documents by adding new objects, create PDF documents with interactive forms, fill and submit interactive forms, merge and split PDF documents, extract text and images from PDF documents, search text in PDF documents, rasterize PDF pages to images.",hiqpdf_x64,False,2017-08-19T11:58:28.39+00:00,True,False,"HiQPdf HTML to PDF Converter for .NET offers you a modern, fast, flexible and powerful tool to create complex and stylish PDF documents in .NET applications with just a few lines of C# code.","html,pdf,c#,vb.net,converter,library,.net,html-to-pdf,pdf-library",10620,False,10.0.0

      The project uses tor its repository work Dapper as ORM and Dapper.FactCRUD for fluentness. But you can use is as a foundation and with any IDbConnection and IDbTransient framework you like.
      
      The library gives you the building blocks to:
      * Create Sessions from the IDbFactory in your methods, IDbFactory should be injected into your class's. As Session extends IDbConnection and will Open on the factory spawning the session and dispose the connection on disposal of the connection.
      * Your Sessions can create UnitOfWork's. As Session extends IDbConnection and will Open on the factory spawning the session and dispose the connection on disposal of the connection.
      * If your logic just needs ""just a"" UnitOfWork with a session that has the same scope, the factory can create it for you.
      * The IRepository and abstract concrete class should be used on your individual repository classes to provide simple and basic calls.
