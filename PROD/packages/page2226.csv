It supports basic CRUD operations on any C# object, with some additional features such as:

* Strongly typed mapping between documents and C# class types with generics
* Generic Repository with support for LINQ queries against objects and their children (where the DocumentDB client supports it)
* Limited cross-document transactional support
* Limited Partitioned Collection Support (partition on Id or ClassName)
* In-memory database, and event history for testing
* Profiling (e.g. Duration and Query Cost in Request Units)
* Automatic Id and timestamp management of object hierarchies 
* Automatic retries of queries when limits are exceeded
