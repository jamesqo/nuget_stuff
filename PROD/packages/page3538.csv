The response from the downstream service is stored in a per request scoped repository and retrived as the requests goes back up the Ocelot pipeline.

        ASP.NET WebForms web applications/web sites. DocumentUltimate can also be used with
        .NET desktop applications for conversion between several document formats.

Features:

- Universal web document viewer which works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

- Crystal-clear zooming. High resolution rendering, preserving text and graphics (no rasterization) exactly as they are in the original.

- Fast document loading, the whole document is not loaded at once, document pages are loaded as you are about to view them.

- Search text within document. Navigate with bookmarks/outlines.

- Change page layout modes (e.g. single page or facing pages), rotate pages and view on full screen.

- Print, download original or download as PDF inside the viewer.

- Secure document viewing, copy protection (DRM). Viewed documents are encrypted so they are copy-protected out of the box. Ability to disable downloading the original document or replicating it via printing or selecting and copying text.

- Watermark document pages with text or image. Customize the watermarks with wide range of options e.g. position, size, rotation, opacity, color.

- Pre-higlight keywords in the document, e.g. if you launch the document viewer from a search results page, you can higlight the searched keywords.

- Self-contained conversion engine, no external dependencies, e.g. you don't need to install Microsoft Office on your server.

- Single managed DLL which works both on 32-bit and 64-bit for hassle-free development and deployment.

- Supports being used in desktop or console applications for converting between document formats. Only the document viewer is dependant on web applications.

gtdev,2018-03-16T17:18:42.403Z,9,35,"DocumentUltimate is an ASP.NET Document Viewer and Converter which supports both ASP.NET MVC and
        ASP.NET WebForms web applications/web sites. DocumentUltimate can also be used with
        .NET desktop applications for conversion between several document formats.

Features:

- Universal web document viewer which works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

- Crystal-clear zooming. High resolution rendering, preserving text and graphics (no rasterization) exactly as they are in the original.

- Fast document loading, the whole document is not loaded at once, document pages are loaded as you are about to view them.

- Search text within document. Navigate with bookmarks/outlines.

- Change page layout modes (e.g. single page or facing pages), rotate pages and view on full screen.

- Print, download original or download as PDF inside the viewer.

- Secure document viewing, copy protection (DRM). Viewed documents are encrypted so they are copy-protected out of the box. Ability to disable downloading the original document or replicating it via printing or selecting and copying text.

- Watermark document pages with text or image. Customize the watermarks with wide range of options e.g. position, size, rotation, opacity, color.

- Pre-higlight keywords in the document, e.g. if you launch the document viewer from a search results page, you can higlight the searched keywords.

- Self-contained conversion engine, no external dependencies, e.g. you don't need to install Microsoft Office on your server.

- Single managed DLL which works both on 32-bit and 64-bit for hassle-free development and deployment.

- Supports being used in desktop or console applications for converting between document formats. Only the document viewer is dependant on web applications.
