ConEmu may work as either standalone window, or embeddable console control. And it may host two types of applications:

* ‘graphical’ (GUI): Notepad, PuTTY, GVim, mintty and so on.

* predefined and user-defined tasks for different shells;
* user friendly text and block selection and paste;
* smooth and friendly window resizing;
* Windows 7 Jump Lists and Progress on Taskbar buttons;
* DosBox integration: run old DOS applications (games) in modern OS;
* quake-style and full screen window modes;
* ANSI sequences and Xterm 256 colors;
