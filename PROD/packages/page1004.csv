The log4net package is designed so that log statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not logging) is crucial.\nAt the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4net is the notion of hierarchical loggers. Using these loggers it is possible to selectively control which log statements are output at arbitrary granularity.\nlog4net is designed with two distinct goals in mind: speed and flexibility\nThis patch applies bugfixes LOG4NET-455 and LOG4NET-462",log4net-await,False,1900-01-01T00:00:00+00:00,False,False,Apache log4net with patch await support,,-1,False,2.1.13

The log4net package is designed so that log statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not logging) is crucial.\nAt the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4net is the notion of hierarchical loggers. Using these loggers it is possible to selectively control which log statements are output at arbitrary granularity.\nlog4net is designed with two distinct goals in mind: speed and flexibility\nThis patch applies bugfixes LOG4NET-455 and LOG4NET-462",log4net-await,False,1900-01-01T00:00:00+00:00,False,False,Apache log4net with patch await support,,-1,False,2.1.13.5
