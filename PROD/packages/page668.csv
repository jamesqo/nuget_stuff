Vyacheslav Volkov,2014-11-22T17:15:15.74Z,333,1245,"This package contains the 'Getting Started' assemblies for MugenMvvmToolkit.WinForms.
      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
      - Xamarin.iOS
      - Xamarin.Forms
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:
      - Deep integration with each platform.
      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.
      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.
      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.
      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.
      - Binding parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Binding supports fluent syntax.
      - Excellent binding performance.",MugenMvvmToolkit.StarterPack.WinForms,True,2017-05-22T09:37:49.303-07:00,True,False,,"mugen,mvvm,toolkit,binding,wpf,winforms,android,windows,phone,winrt,cross,platform,ios",3651,False,1.0.0-beta2

Picoe Software Solutions Inc.,2014-11-22T05:31:31.497Z,58,1245,"Eto.Forms is a cross platform desktop user interface framework.

This framework is built so that you can target multiple platforms with one UI codebase.

The goal of this framework is to expose a common API that can be used to build functional applications that run across platforms using their native toolkit. This will make your applications look and work as if it were a native application on all platforms.

For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a custom implementations per platform.

This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac/Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.

In order to run your Eto.Forms based application, you must also install one (or more) of the following packages:

- Eto.Platform.Wpf
- Eto.Platform.Windows
- Eto.Platform.Direct2D
- Eto.Platform.Gtk
- Eto.Platform.Gtk3
- Eto.Platform.Mac
- Eto.Platform.XamMac  * requires Xamarin Studio on OS X.
- Eto.Platform.XamMac2  * requires Xamarin Studio on OS X.

      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
      - Xamarin.iOS
      - Xamarin.Forms
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:
      - Deep integration with each platform.
      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.
      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.
      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.
      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.
      - Binding parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Binding supports fluent syntax.

      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android

      - Xamarin.Forms
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:
      - Deep integration with each platform.
      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.
      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.
      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.
      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.
      - Binding parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Binding supports fluent syntax.

      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
      - Xamarin.iOS
      - Xamarin.Forms
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:
      - Deep integration with each platform.
      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.
      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.
      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.
      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.
      - Binding parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Binding supports fluent syntax.
      - Excellent binding performance.",MugenMvvmToolkit,True,2017-05-22T09:34:33.637-07:00,True,False,,"mugen,mvvm,toolkit,binding,wpf,winforms,android,windows,phone,winrt,cross,platform,ios",-1,False,3.2.0-beta2

      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
      - Xamarin.iOS
      - Xamarin.Forms
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:
      - Deep integration with each platform.
      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.
      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.
      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.
      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.

      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.

      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
      - Xamarin.iOS
      - Xamarin.Forms
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:
      - Deep integration with each platform.
      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.
      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.
      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.
      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.
      - Binding parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Binding supports fluent syntax.
      - Excellent binding performance.",MugenMvvmToolkit.StarterPack.Xamarin.Forms,True,2017-05-22T09:37:59.227-07:00,True,False,,"mugen,mvvm,toolkit,binding,wpf,winforms,android,windows,phone,winrt,cross,platform,ios",3941,False,1.0.0-beta2

GroupDocs,2014-11-21T15:30:56.567Z,1117,1246,"GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET is a flexible library that allows you to generate documents by filling out merge fields in PDF or Word templates with data obtained from a DB or user input. The library can be of great help if you need to generate lots of custom documents that have a standard template, but need to be filled out with unique data. These could be invoices, bills, order quotes, offer letters, NDAs, legal documents, insurance policies, etc.

The library comes with a web UI which allows end users to prepare templates and get the completed documents without any assistance from developers. Easy to follow wizards guide end users through the document assembly process, which includes the following steps:

1. Upload a template in a PDF, DOC or DOCX format with merge fields that should be populated with data.

2. Compose an online questionnaire associated with the merge fields in the template and publish it on the web.

3. Invite users to complete the questionnaire.

For each completed questionnaire a new unique document is generated. The document looks exactly like the template but includes data populated into the merge fields.

Key Features & Benefits:

-  Templates can be filled in with data obtained from web forms or a DB.
-  Support for different types of form fields: text box, check box, lists and combo, radio buttons, etc.
-  Ability to set default values and rules for questions (for example set value range and limits for respond length).
-  Ability to handle JavaScript events (for example onTemplateCreated, onTemplateMerge, etc.).
-  Documents are generated on-the-fly, each time a questionnaire is completed.
-  Convenient UI allows end users to generate documents without any assistance from developers.
