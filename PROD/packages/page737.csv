So, what to do about it? We made one ourselves – the VirtualizingObservableCollection, which does the following:
◾Implements the same interfaces as ObsevableCollection<T> so you can use it anywhere you’d use an ObsevableCollection<T> – no need to change any of your existing controls.
◾Supports true multi-user read/write without resets (maximizing performance for large-scale concurrency scenarios).
◾Manages memory on its own so it never runs out of memory, no matter how large the data set is (especially important for mobile devices).
◾Natively works asynchronously – great for slow network connections and occasionally-connected models.
◾Works great out of the box, but is flexible and extendable enough to customize for your needs.
◾Has a data access performance curve so good it’s just as fast as the regular ObsevableCollection – the cost of using it is negligible.

So, what to do about it? We made one ourselves – the VirtualizingObservableCollection, which does the following:
◾Implements the same interfaces as ObsevableCollection<T> so you can use it anywhere you’d use an ObsevableCollection<T> – no need to change any of your existing controls.
◾Supports true multi-user read/write without resets (maximizing performance for large-scale concurrency scenarios).
◾Manages memory on its own so it never runs out of memory, no matter how large the data set is (especially important for mobile devices).
◾Natively works asynchronously – great for slow network connections and occasionally-connected models.
◾Works great out of the box, but is flexible and extendable enough to customize for your needs.
◾Has a data access performance curve so good it’s just as fast as the regular ObsevableCollection – the cost of using it is negligible.
◾Works in any .NET project because it’s implemented in a Portable Code Library (PCL).",VirtualizingObservableCollection,False,2015-03-31T11:43:02.803-07:00,True,False,PCL Implementation of a VirtualizingObservableCollection that implements full editing and is highly performing.,"mvvm,wpf,windowsstore,win8,windowsphone,windowsphone8,xamarin,xaramin.forms,virtualization",8069,False,0.8.3
