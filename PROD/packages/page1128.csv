DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

DawgSharp is an open-source C# implementation featuring a linear time graph reduction algorithm and out-of-the-box persistence support. 

The two main objects in the library are Dawg and DawgBuilder. Dawg is immutable, you must use DawgBuilder to build a Dawg and then save it to a stream. Then use Dawg.Load to rehydrate the data. Once reloaded, Dawg re-emerges as a completely different data structure (but, oddly, the same class) that is nearly as fast as a HashSet for lookups and is much, much more memory-efficient (factors of 30x - 40x are not uncommon). Please note that the Save/Load step is necessary to get the full potential out of the Dawg object. Use a MemoryStream if disk interaction is not desired.

The Dawg class can be thought of as a read-only Dictionary <string, Value> type. It has the [""""] indexer and implements IEnumerable <KeyValuePair <string, Value>>. 

One other very useful feature of Dawg (not found in Dictionary) is the ability to quickly find all words that start with a particular substring: dawg.MatchPrefix (""star"") could possibly yield ""star"", ""starch"", ""start"", ""starting"", etc.

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).
