Richard Harrison,2013-08-10T09:37:49.267Z,155,1714,"The basic premise of the Emesary messaging system is to allow the decoupled operation of the various components that comprise any system - usually within the same process. 

The basic unit of communication is a Notification, which is passed around to any and or all objects that implement the IReceive interface. Using Interfaces and ihneritance it is possible to pass around Notifications that have special meanings to certain objects and allow them to perform the appropriate function.

In our design Notifications are created and sent via a call to NotifyAll. Any object within the system can implement the IReceive interface and register itself with either a Queue (WIP) or a Transmitter to receive all notifications that are sent out. The underlying concept is that one part of a system knows that something needs to be done without needing to know how to do it. The part of the system that needs something done simply creates a notification and sends it out. Once received by the part of the system that is capable of performing the requested Notification the relevant actions will be carried out and a status of OK or Finished returned. See the section on return codes for a complete explanation of these codes and what they mean.

This new destination listener extension is called ReflectSoftware.Insight.Listeners.Email and allows you to send logging messages via email. This is typically done for Exceptions, Errors and Fatal messages types where you might want to be notified via email if something went wrong in your application.

Traditional simple text base logging frameworks lack what your application can easily emit in providing you better insight into the health of your application. Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand.

Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes.
