Wim van Gool,2017-11-10T08:40:37.287Z,30,161,"The Kingo TestEngine library contains a few simple components that allow you to create unit tests
      and integration tests in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style on top of applications that
      were implemented using the MicroProcessor design from the Kingo library. You are, of source, free to
      choose whatever unit test framework you like to run your tests and verify your test results.

      The TestEngine contains two base classes for your tests: WriteScenario<T> and ReadScenario<T>.
      The WriteScenario<T> can be extended to implement unit tests that execute against your business logic
      (message handlers), whereas the ReadScenario<T> can be extended to execute and test your queries.
      Both classes use the Given()/When()/Then() style to initialize, execute and verify your tests and its results.

      The beauty of these scenario classes is that they can re-use and be built on top of each other to create ever
      more sophisticated tests without much effort or extra code. In other words, composite scenarios can execute
      child scenarios inside their Given() phase to initialize their own begin-state. This way, composite scenarios
      build upon previously verified logic and resulting program states, which ensures your tests never run in a
      corrupt or unreachable program state.

      The Kingo TestEngine also opens the door to easily generate documentation from your unit tests and integration tests.

            * The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.
            * The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
            * For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
            * The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
            * Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
            * Handles circular references.
            * The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
                - the order in which the properties are dumped;
                - formatting of the property names and/or values;
                - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
                - masking the values of sensitive properties (e.g. PII);
                - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
                - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
            * The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
            * Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.
            * Built and tested with .NET 4.6.2.
