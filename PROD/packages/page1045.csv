Reduce development time by writing less code. Slazure's schema-free approach to data eliminates the need for strongly typed entity definitions, ORM's, and ODM's - with Slazure, your code defines your schema.

Run dynamically typed declarative queries on a schema-free data model. Compose dynamically typed LINQ-queries on the fly at run-time with Slazure's powerful Linq Provider.

Writing high-performance queries is easy with Slazure's query optimizer

The Slazure Linq Provider's query optimizer builds fast OData queries that retrieves only what is requested. Retrieve only the entity properties you need with query projections rather that the whole entity. Retrieve only a subset of the data set rather than the whole set. Skip part of the data set rather than reading from the beginning. Order entities on the storage before they are retrieved rather than retrieving the whole data set and sorting it afterwards.

Reduce development time by writing less code. Slazure's schema-free approach to data eliminates the need for strongly typed entity definitions, ORM's, and ODM's - with Slazure, your code defines your schema.

Run dynamically typed declarative queries on a schema-free data model. Compose dynamically typed LINQ-queries on the fly at run-time with Slazure's powerful Linq Provider.

Writing high-performance queries is easy with Slazure's query optimizer

The Slazure Linq Provider's query optimizer builds fast OData queries that retrieves only what is requested. Retrieve only the entity properties you need with query projections rather that the whole entity. Retrieve only a subset of the data set rather than the whole set. Skip part of the data set rather than reading from the beginning. Order entities on the storage before they are retrieved rather than retrieving the whole data set and sorting it afterwards.

Slazure's Dynamic Expression API supports Substitution Values through a parameter array. The expression language supports Logical & Additive operators. Accessible types support method & constructor invocations. Use the object model API to query the storage.

Reduce development time by writing less code. Slazure's schema-free approach to data eliminates the need for strongly typed entity definitions, ORM's, and ODM's - with Slazure, your code defines your schema.

Run dynamically typed declarative queries on a schema-free data model. Compose dynamically typed LINQ-queries on the fly at run-time with Slazure's powerful Linq Provider.

Writing high-performance queries is easy with Slazure's query optimizer

The Slazure Linq Provider's query optimizer builds fast OData queries that retrieves only what is requested. Retrieve only the entity properties you need with query projections rather that the whole entity. Retrieve only a subset of the data set rather than the whole set. Skip part of the data set rather than reading from the beginning. Order entities on the storage before they are retrieved rather than retrieving the whole data set and sorting it afterwards.

Reduce development time by writing less code. Slazure's schema-free approach to data eliminates the need for strongly typed entity definitions, ORM's, and ODM's - with Slazure, your code defines your schema.

Run dynamically typed declarative queries on a schema-free data model. Compose dynamically typed LINQ-queries on the fly at run-time with Slazure's powerful Linq Provider.

Writing high-performance queries is easy with Slazure's query optimizer

The Slazure Linq Provider's query optimizer builds fast OData queries that retrieves only what is requested. Retrieve only the entity properties you need with query projections rather that the whole entity. Retrieve only a subset of the data set rather than the whole set. Skip part of the data set rather than reading from the beginning. Order entities on the storage before they are retrieved rather than retrieving the whole data set and sorting it afterwards.

Slazure's Dynamic Expression API supports Substitution Values through a parameter array. The expression language supports Logical & Additive operators. Accessible types support method & constructor invocations. Use the object model API to query the storage.
