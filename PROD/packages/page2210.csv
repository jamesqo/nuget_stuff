PROBLEM SPACE

Helps to (a) create an element provider, where producing an element can take a lot of time
due to dependency on other asynchronous events (e.g. wait handles, network streams), and
(b) a consumer that processes those element as soon as they are ready without blocking
the thread (the processing is scheduled on a worker thread instead).

    // This won't be executed due to the loop break above

Algorithmia is one of the pillars of LLBLGen Pro and is used in production successfully since May 2010. Many of the classes and algorithms in Algorithmia contain references to papers and articles on Wikipedia or other websites where you can find additional information regarding the algorithm or data-structure implemented.

The core design of Algorithmia is about making algorithms and data-structures which are known for many years available to the .NET developer in easy to use and properly documented classes and methods. No class or method implemented in Algorithmia re-implements a .NET BCL (base class library) class or method unless it was necessary to do so (e.g. the linked list in .NET is re-implemented as it doesn't have an O(1) concat operation, which is necessary for the Fibonacci heap).",SD.Tools.Algorithmia,True,2018-02-09T16:21:26.237+00:00,True,False,"Advanced algorithm and data-structure library for .NET 3.5 and up.

The nuu:bit Mobile SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of libraries that provide the means necessary to report and accelerate the delivery of content to applications running on mobile devices. The nuu:bit SDK utilizes a specially designed set of networking protocols to provide acceleration to a given mobile application.  Network traffic that is normally directed to and from the mobile App is sent through the nuu:bit SDK, which utilizes nuu:bit’s global network to accelerate the App’s traffic.

The SDK can function utilizing  either of two nuu:bit-optimized protocols – an UDP-based protocol NMP (nuu:bit Mobile Protocol) or TCP-based protocol DOTS (Dynamically Optimized Transport System) to transfer the content over the wireless network. The SDK determines, which protocol provides better performance for that particular App, device, and wireless network at that moment in time.

For Developers

The Web Blocks system has been developed to encapsulate code for each block in a re-usable and loosely coupled way. Blocks can now makes use of Partial Views, neatly organising your scripts into re-usable and shareable snippets. Templates can be developed to be pre-populated with blocks and also blocks can be added retrospectively to templates populating all pages using this template with the new block that has been added. For interface developers the Web Blocks system is very flexible and can adapted to work with any interface framework.

The Web Blocks system provides the ability to drag blocks of content into defined areas on a preview canvas, directly from the content tree. Users can create blocks in the content tree in the same way as creating normal pages i.e. from pre-defined block/content types.  Content editors can also update their content live from the front end of the web site.  Blocks behave just like any other node in the content tree and can have parameters just like normal content pages.
