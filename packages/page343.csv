Unlike any other .NET MIME parser, MimeKit's parser does not need to parse string input nor does it use a TextReader. Instead, it parses raw byte streams, thus allowing it to better support undeclared 8bit text in headers as well as message bodies. It also means that MimeKit's parser is significantly faster than other .NET MIME parsers.

MimeKit's parser also uses a real tokenizer when parsing the headers rather than regex or string.Split() like most other .NET MIME parsers. This means that MimeKit is much more RFC-compliant than any other .NET MIME parser out there, including the commercial implementations.

Each test case is built up progressively from smaller pieces of data that are combined together.

The smallest pieces are referred to as 'test variables'. Each test variable is constrained to take values from its own set of allowed 'levels'.

Changing each test variable independently to a new level produces a new test case.

If a test requires a certain 'strength' of coverage of combinations of levels from different test variables, the library produces a stream of test cases that honour this guarantee while avoiding getting swamped with a combinatoric explosion of test cases.

If a parameterised test fails with an exception for a specific test case, the library creates a signature that allows it to reproduce the failing test case immediately in a separate test; this is to aid debugging.
