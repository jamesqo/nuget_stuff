"Captcha,Inc.",2013-11-19T16:08:01.813Z,"BotDetect CAPTCHA protects ASP.NET forms from automated spam submissions. Highly customizable, secure and accessible Captcha protection is available for ASP.NET WebForms and ASP.NET MVC web applications.

BotDetect is unique among Captcha solutions in offering many Captcha image and sound styles. While each of them is easily comprehensible to human users, randomly using multiple Captcha generation algorithms makes the Captcha challenge practically impossible to pass automatically. This approach to Captcha security is validated by the BotDetect track record: we have over 2500 paying customers and not one confirmed case of automated Captcha breaking by spammers.
    
BotDetect provides an audio Captcha alternative to keep ASP.NET web applications accessible to the blind and other people for whom reading the Captcha code could be a problem, enabling you to make WCAG and Section 508 compliant websites.

Features
  * 60 secure & readable Captcha image styles
  * 10 secure & accessible audio Captcha sound styles
  * Localized Captcha generation, using various Unicode character sets and downloadable multi-language sound pronunciations
  * Custom Captcha image size, format, color scheme...
  * Custom Captcha code length, style, character set, timeouts, generated code filtering...
  * Many other randomization & customization options
  * Produces XHTML 1.1 Strict, Section 508 and WCAG AAA compliant markup
  * Visual Studio .NET 2013, 2012, 2010, 2008, 2005 and 2003 Designer support
  * Medium trust environment support for shared servers
  * Fully compatible with ASP.NET WebForms and ASP.NET MVC applications
  * Fully compatible with ASP.NET Ajax and jQuery Ajax validation
  * Fully compatible with SharePoint Server / Foundation
  * Tested in IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera browsers released since 2001.

Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand. 

Everyone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight’s Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!

ReflectSoftware,2013-11-19T05:22:27.92Z,"We've added a new destination listener extension for ReflectInsight for sending emails. This new destination listener extension is called ReflectSoftware.Insight.Listeners.Email and allows you to send logging messages via email. This is typically done for Exceptions, Errors and Fatal messages types where you might want to be notified via email if something went wrong in your application.

Traditional simple text base logging frameworks lack what your application can easily emit in providing you better insight into the health of your application. Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand. 

Everyone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight’s Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!

In order to use this library you must have the ReflectInsight Viewer installed. Download and install the ReflectInsight Viewer from this location: 

http://www.ReflectSoftware.com/Public/Download.aspx
