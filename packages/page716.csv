Tomasz Leszczynski,2015-01-14T12:32:12.453Z,"- Auto-mapping: You do not need to explicitly define the mapping between entity objects and database tables. UFO automatically performs mapping by combining the names of the class properties of the entity with the names of the parameters of SQL queries / stored procedures.

- Bidirectional Mapping: UFO accepts entity objects as source parameters for SQL queries and stored procedures. The results of SQL queries / stored procedures are also returned as such entity objects.

- No SQL generator: Writing the SQL / Stored Procedures code by yourself. The code generated by the ORM engines invariably turns out to be slow and complicated.

- Lack of nested types and ""lazy loading"": ... and other gadgets slowing down the process ... Sorry. Only pure and fast mapping!

- POCO Entities: using ""pure"" classes of entities with no special attributes, additional mapping files or any other additions that obscure the code.

- Extremely fast: UFO reads the entity class structure and the parameters of SQL queries / stored procedures only once, and then moves them to the FAST cache.

- MS SQL Server: UFO supports the Microsoft SQL Server by default, but thanks to its modular design, you can enter your own provider for another database.

- Insert / Update: Support for fast insert and update of large amounts of data.

- Multiple formats for the transmission of input parameters: 1) Entity objects as the source of parameters (bidirectional mapping) for SQL queries and stored procedures. 2) Numbered parameters for SQL queries. 3) Ordered parameters for stored procedures.

- POCOgen (POCO generator): UFO includes an application that allows to generate pure POCO entity classes based on the structure of the database.
