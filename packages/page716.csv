UFO automatically performs mapping by combining the names of the class properties of the entity with the names of the parameters of SQL queries / stored procedures.

- Bidirectional Mapping: UFO accepts entity objects as source parameters for SQL queries and stored procedures. The results of SQL queries / stored procedures are also returned as such entity objects.

- No SQL generator: Writing the SQL / Stored Procedures code by yourself. The code generated by the ORM engines invariably turns out to be slow and complicated.

- Lack of nested types and ""lazy loading"": ... and other gadgets slowing down the process ... Sorry. Only pure and fast mapping!

- POCO Entities: using ""pure"" classes of entities with no special attributes, additional mapping files or any other additions that obscure the code.

- Extremely fast: UFO reads the entity class structure and the parameters of SQL queries / stored procedures only once, and then moves them to the FAST cache.

- MS SQL Server: UFO supports the Microsoft SQL Server by default, but thanks to its modular design, you can enter your own provider for another database.

- Insert / Update: Support for fast insert and update of large amounts of data.

- Multiple formats for the transmission of input parameters: 1) Entity objects as the source of parameters (bidirectional mapping) for SQL queries and stored procedures. 2) Numbered parameters for SQL queries. 3) Ordered parameters for stored procedures.

- POCOgen (POCO generator): UFO includes an application that allows to generate pure POCO entity classes based on the structure of the database.
