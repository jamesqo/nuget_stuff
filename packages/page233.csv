Thomas Maierhofer,2013-05-12T11:08:50.223Z,"NHunspell is a spell checking, hyphenation, word stemming and thesaurus library based on Hunspell.
      NHunspell can use OpenOffice dictionaries for spell checking, hyphenation and thesaurus.
      It is an alternative to GNU Aspell, ISpell, PSpell and Enchant.
      
      It wraps the native libraries for Hunspell and Hyphen. It contains a fully managed version of MyThes.
      The NHunspell package installs a PostBuild event which copies the unmanaged Hunspell dlls into the bin folder.
      The NHunspell package doesn't install dictionaries. Dictionaries can be found at
      http://extensions.openoffice.org/en/dictionaries.
      OpenOffice dictionaries (.oxt) are Zip  files and contain the real dictionaries.
      
      Important: Dictionaries have an own licence. Check the dictionary licence before you use them.
