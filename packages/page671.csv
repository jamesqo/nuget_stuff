WebMarkupMin absorbed the best of existing solutions from non-microsoft platforms: Juriy Zaytsev's Experimental HTML Minifier (http://kangax.github.com/html-minifier/) (written in JavaScript) and Sergiy Kovalchuk's HtmlCompressor (http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/) (written in Java).

Minification of markup produces by removing extra whitespaces, comments and redundant code (only for HTML and XHTML). In addition, HTML and XHTML minifiers supports the minification of CSS code from style tags and attributes, and minification of JavaScript code from script tags, event attributes and hyperlinks with javascript: protocol.

      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
      - Xamarin.iOS
      - Xamarin.Forms
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:
      - Deep integration with each platform.
      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.
      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.
      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.
      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.
      - Binding parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Binding supports fluent syntax.
      - Excellent binding performance.",MugenMvvmToolkit.WPF,True,2017-05-22T09:35:17.377-07:00,True,False,,"mugen,mvvm,toolkit,binding,wpf,winforms,android,windows,phone,winrt,cross,platform,ios",12706,False,1.2.0-beta3

      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
      - Xamarin.iOS
      - Xamarin.Forms
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:
      - Deep integration with each platform.
      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.
      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.
      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.
      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.
      - Binding parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Binding supports fluent syntax.
      - Excellent binding performance.",MugenMvvmToolkit.WinForms,True,2017-05-22T09:35:07-07:00,True,False,,"mugen,mvvm,toolkit,binding,wpf,winforms,android,windows,phone,winrt,cross,platform,ios",12600,False,1.2.0-beta3
