This library is capable of generating and verifying both TOTP and HOTP authentication codes.  The calculations in this library are known to be compatible with Google 2-Step Verification and consequently the Google Authenticator smartphone app.  It is also known to be able to generate codes for Amazon Web Services Multi Factor Authentication and Dropbox 2 step authentication.  It should work with any other service or client that is RFC compliant.

This library is released under an MIT license. No warranty is provided as to the correctness of the library and the consumer of the library assumes all risk for the use thereof, as per the MIT license.

Every effort has gone into implementing this library in accordance with the RFCs mentioned above. However it is up to the users of this library to read through the RFCs and ensure that this implementation is in accordance with the security procedures outlined therein.

The implementation includes the code calculation as well as simple verification. Persistence of the keys, secure key storage, ensuring that a single code can't be validated multiple times and other things are not a part of this library.

ReflectSoftware,2013-07-30T11:23:42.827Z,"We've added a new destination listener extension for ReflectInsight for sending emails. This new destination listener extension is called ReflectSoftware.Insight.Listeners.Email and allows you to send logging messages via email. This is typically done for Exceptions, Errors and Fatal messages types where you might want to be notified via email if something went wrong in your application.

Traditional simple text base logging frameworks lack what your application can easily emit in providing you better insight into the health of your application. Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand. 

Everyone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight’s Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!

In order to use this library you must have the ReflectInsight Viewer installed. Download and install the ReflectInsight Viewer from this location: 

http://www.ReflectSoftware.com/Public/Download.aspx

Alexander Paskhin/ paskhin@hotmail.co.uk,2013-07-29T11:46:19.417Z,"MVVM pattern is widely used in developing of XAML-based GUI applications. Without using this pattern it is impossible to provide the quality UX design implementations. Quality of UX design directly depends on the techniques or features that used for implementing the MVVM pattern. The most important features are to solve the “clear” separation tasks between View (the XAML code coupled with its code-behind) and ViewModel. 
Digital agencies are very often involved in providing the quality UX design solutions for application products. This process is based on separated development by two companies’ one application. Design agency develops View (XAML) part and Technology or Business Company concentrates on developing functional parts: View Model and Model. 
Here we have got a task when two different languages XAML and C# contracted together delivered by different companies. 
This project provides the transparent and professional package for developing quality UX design solutions. Without using these features or similar it is impossible to say that your XAML UX design has a quality. 
Well known Binding markup extension can bind only two properties together. The source property can be located either in Resources or either in code-behind. These standard framework features don’t allow developers to separate View from View Model. The volume of code behind development decrease quality of GUI, increase complicity and cost of maintainability. Change in View can cause the dramatic change of the code behind layer. 
For high quality UX implementation with XAML you need separate or by other words bind over the framework XAML with ICommand and RoutedEventHandler which are located in the View Model.",MvvmBindingPack,False,2018-01-09T00:40:10.393+00:00,True,False,Provides the transparent and professional package for developing quality UX design solutions.

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand. 

Everyone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight’s Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!

In order to use this library you must have the ReflectInsight Viewer installed. Download and install the ReflectInsight Viewer from this location:

This library is capable of generating and verifying both TOTP and HOTP authentication codes.  The calculations in this library are known to be compatible with Google 2-Step Verification and consequently the Google Authenticator smartphone app.  It is also known to be able to generate codes for Amazon Web Services Multi Factor Authentication and Dropbox 2 step authentication.  It should work with any other service or client that is RFC compliant.

This library is released under an MIT license. No warranty is provided as to the correctness of the library and the consumer of the library assumes all risk for the use thereof, as per the MIT license.

Every effort has gone into implementing this library in accordance with the RFCs mentioned above. However it is up to the users of this library to read through the RFCs and ensure that this implementation is in accordance with the security procedures outlined therein.

The implementation includes the code calculation as well as simple verification. Persistence of the keys, secure key storage, ensuring that a single code can't be validated multiple times and other things are not a part of this library. Thus far those functions (and any others mentioned in the RFCs) are up to the consumer of this library.

Traditional simple text base logging frameworks lack what your application can easily emit in providing you better insight into the health of your application. Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand. 

Everyone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight’s Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!

In order to use this library you must have the ReflectInsight Viewer installed. Download and install the ReflectInsight Viewer from this location: 

http://www.ReflectSoftware.com/Public/Download.aspx

You can view your messages in realtime, in a rich viewer that allows you to filter out and search for what really matters to you.",ReflectSoftware.Insight.Listeners.Email,False,2018-01-29T17:03:09.757+00:00,True,False,"ReflectInsight - The Next Generation in Application Logging.

Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand. 

Everyone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight’s Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!

In order to use this library you must have the ReflectInsight Viewer installed. Download and install the ReflectInsight Viewer from this location:

      What make difference?
      ============
      > 功能特色
      > =======

      - Full support for Data Contract Serializing. You can easily save your status of View Model to JSON or XML stream, and easily restore from, too.
      >全面支持Data Contract序列化 可以将一个VM的全部状态用任何方式保存为JSON/XML,反序列化后只需要简单操作就可以恢复工作


      - This is light-weight framework. You can use our dll or use code file, either way you just need to install Reactive Extensions with Nuget.
      >轻量级框架，不必安装全部DLL或者引用工程，只需要将指定代码文件加入你的工程切安装Reactive Extensions就可以用。


      - Each of Model Properties in MVVM-Sidekick has it's own event container, can subscribe or broadcast it self. LinQ-Like code with RX can be used.
      >Model所有的成员都有自己的事件容器，可以独立与其他事件订阅与广播。可以使用 LinQ-Like 语法进行配置和订阅。



      - You can configure business logic of your properties and commands where they were declared. This will avoid your jumping between different parts in one View Model code file. (This kills me when I was working with other frameworks: for example you cannot configure a `DelayCommand` at the ***Property/Field declaration*** because “***this***” instance is not ready yet .)
      >您可以在声明property的代码处配置property的业务细节，可以在声明command的代码处配置command的业务细节,这样你就不用在一个VM里面不同的代码段跳来跳去了。（用别的框架可累死我了，声明个command 还不能在声明原地初始化，因为this还没有实例化）



      - You can also separate the business logic to your View Model declaration into a decorator factory or something else, to manage ***all code involved one same USE CASE together***, with the sequence same as document you a following. You can also easily add more business logic anywhere you like.
      >您也可以将VM的业务细节配置与VM的创建时机分离，不但可以在实体外用装饰模式进行批量配置(这样可以让代码与需求文档的组织顺序高度统一，便于维护)，也可以根据需要临时装饰增加VM的功能。
