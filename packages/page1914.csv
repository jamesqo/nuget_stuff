-	All the namespaces are converted from usual org.apache.lucene.* to FlexLucene.*. 
-	All method names are converted to use .net style naming convention that is PascalCase rather than camelCase.
-	All Java hashCode methods are converted to GetHashCode.
-	Proper Equals and ToString implementation for classes.
-	There are certain cases when the method name cannot be converted as it is coming from a java SDK class (i.e. close method present in classes implementing Closable). In such cases we have added a helper method to the class with the proper name (PascalCase).
-	Java allows usage of same name for a public field and method which is not possible in C#. Such cases are handled by renaming the field.

A lot more refinements and optimizations are planned in future.

Changes 6.0
-   Upgraded the version of spatial4j which lead to many namespace changes.
-   Lucene has deprecated a number of classes. Refer to Lucene 6.0.0 release notes for a list of changes.
