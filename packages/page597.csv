Using the high quality HTML to PDF conversion engine you can easily design a document in HTML with CSS3, JavaScript, SVG or Canvas and then convert it to PDF preserving the exact content and style.

The HiQPdf Library for .NET offers you the fastest and the most precise HTML to PDF conversion tchnology to use in your Web and Desktop applications. The HTML to PDF Converter can convert to PDF any HTML document or URL that a modern browser can display, preserving all the CSS styles and executing all the JavaScript scripts found in the HTML document.

Besides the common features a HTML to PDF Converter must have, the HiQPdf component has some unique features on the market like the support for web fonts in Web Open Font Format (WOFF), the ability to convert only a selected region of the HTML document or the possibility to overlap multiple HTML documents in the same PDF while preserving the transparent backgrounds and images from the HTML document.

The HiQPdf HTML to PDF Converter can render HTML documents with last generation content like Scalar Vector Graphics, Canvas and CSS3 styles. The JavaScript engine is fast, can handle complex scripts and exposes in HTML page objects you can use to manually trigger conversion or to determine various information about converter during conversion.

The HiQPdf HTML to PDF Converter can render HTML documents using Web Fonts in formats like Web Open Font Format (WOFF), TrueType or OpenType with TrueType Outlines.

Tiny uses the power of Dynamic and ExpandoObject in .Net 4 to 
dynamically populate name-value pairs from the arguments passed to the command line.

Tiny's argument parsing depends on separators for name-value pairs, 
for example if the command line for your app is:

c:\code\myapp\bin\myapp testargument1:testvalue testargument2:with_a:in_the_value testargument3

Note: The default separator for Tiny is ':'.

The code for parsing these arguments through Tiny is:

static void Main(string[] args) { Tiny t = new Tiny(args); }

You can read the passed arguments directly as properties via your code by writing code like this:

t.Arguments.testargument1 t.Arguments.testargument2

Any argument without a specified separator gets the name of UndefinedArgumentX where X is the number of the encountered argument without a separator.

Amit Patankar,2014-09-08T20:58:10.107Z,"A tiny C# class to handle arguments sent to a console application.
Tiny uses the power of dynamic and ExpandoObject in .Net 4 to dynamically populate name-value pairs from the arguments passed to the command line.
The inspiration from Tiny came from Rob Conery's Micro-Orm project - Massive, where he used the power of dynamic to display some really cool magic.
Tiny's argument parsing depends on separators for name-value pairs, for example if the command line for your app is:
c:\code\myapp\bin\myapp testargument1:testvalue testargument2:with_a:in_the_value testargument3
Note: The default separator for Tiny is ':'.
The code for parsing these arguments through Tiny is:
static void Main(string[] args) {
 Tiny t = new Tiny(args); 
}
You can read the passed arguments directly as properties via your code by writing code like this:
t.Arguments.testargument1;
t.Arguments.testargument2;
Any argument without a specified separator gets the name of UndefinedArgumentX where X is the number of the encountered argument without a separator.
In the above example, the last argument can be read via:
t.Arguments.UndefinedArgument1;",Tiny,False,2014-10-20T10:10:02.34-07:00,True,False,A tiny C# class to handle arguments sent to a console application.,"Command,line,arguments",1391,False,1.0.0

Minification of markup produces by removing extra whitespaces, comments and redundant code (only for HTML and XHTML). In addition, HTML and XHTML minifiers supports the minification of CSS code from style tags and attributes, and minification of JavaScript code from script tags, event attributes and hyperlinks with javascript: protocol. WebMarkupMin.Core contains built-in JavaScript minifier based on the Douglas Crockford's JSMin (http://github.com/douglascrockford/JSMin) and built-in CSS minifier based on the Mads Kristensen's Efficient stylesheet minifier (http://madskristensen.net/post/Efficient-stylesheet-minification-in-C.aspx). The above mentioned minifiers produce only the most simple minifications of CSS and JavaScript code, but you can always install additional modules that support the more powerful algorithms of minification: WebMarkupMin.MsAjax (contains minifier-adapters for the Microsoft Ajax Minifier - http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com) and WebMarkupMin.Yui (contains minifier-adapters for YUI Compressor for .Net - http://github.com/PureKrome/YUICompressor.NET).
