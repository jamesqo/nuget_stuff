Tiny uses the power of Dynamic and ExpandoObject in .Net 4 to 
dynamically populate name-value pairs from the arguments passed to the command line.

Tiny's argument parsing depends on separators for name-value pairs, 
for example if the command line for your app is:

c:\code\myapp\bin\myapp testargument1:testvalue testargument2:with_a:in_the_value testargument3

Note: The default separator for Tiny is ':'.

The code for parsing these arguments through Tiny is:

static void Main(string[] args) { Tiny t = new Tiny(args); }

You can read the passed arguments directly as properties via your code by writing code like this:

t.Arguments.testargument1 t.Arguments.testargument2

Any argument without a specified separator gets the name of UndefinedArgumentX where X is the number of the encountered argument without a separator.

Minification of markup produces by removing extra whitespaces, comments and redundant code (only for HTML and XHTML).

Tiny uses the power of dynamic and ExpandoObject in .Net 4 to dynamically populate name-value pairs from the arguments passed to the command line.
The inspiration from Tiny came from Rob Conery's Micro-Orm project - Massive, where he used the power of dynamic to display some really cool magic.
Tiny's argument parsing depends on separators for name-value pairs, for example if the command line for your app is:
c:\code\myapp\bin\myapp testargument1:testvalue testargument2:with_a:in_the_value testargument3
Note: The default separator for Tiny is ':'.
The code for parsing these arguments through Tiny is:
static void Main(string[] args) {
 Tiny t = new Tiny(args); 
}
You can read the passed arguments directly as properties via your code by writing code like this:
t.Arguments.testargument1;
t.Arguments.testargument2;
Any argument without a specified separator gets the name of UndefinedArgumentX where X is the number of the encountered argument without a separator.
In the above example, the last argument can be read via:

Andrey Taritsyn,2014-09-09T17:29:16.743Z,348,1319,"The Web Markup Minifier (abbreviated WebMarkupMin) is a .NET library that contains a set of markup minifiers. The objective of this project is to improve the performance of web applications by reducing the size of HTML, XHTML and XML code.

WebMarkupMin absorbed the best of existing solutions from non-microsoft platforms: Juriy Zaytsev's Experimental HTML Minifier (http://kangax.github.com/html-minifier/) (written in JavaScript) and Sergiy Kovalchuk's HtmlCompressor (http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/) (written in Java).

Minification of markup produces by removing extra whitespaces, comments and redundant code (only for HTML and XHTML). In addition, HTML and XHTML minifiers supports the minification of CSS code from style tags and attributes, and minification of JavaScript code from script tags, event attributes and hyperlinks with javascript: protocol. WebMarkupMin.Core contains built-in JavaScript minifier based on the Douglas Crockford's JSMin (http://github.com/douglascrockford/JSMin) and built-in CSS minifier based on the Mads Kristensen's Efficient stylesheet minifier (http://madskristensen.net/post/Efficient-stylesheet-minification-in-C.aspx). The above mentioned minifiers produce only the most simple minifications of CSS and JavaScript code, but you can always install additional modules that support the more powerful algorithms of minification: WebMarkupMin.MsAjax (contains minifier-adapters for the Microsoft Ajax Minifier - http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com) and WebMarkupMin.Yui (contains minifier-adapters for YUI Compressor for .Net - http://github.com/PureKrome/YUICompressor.NET).
