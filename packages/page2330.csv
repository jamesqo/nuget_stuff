Currently supported dbs are :Azure DocumentDb (via DataStore.Impl.DocumentDb package).

It supports basic CRUD operations on any C# object, with some additional features such as:

* Strongly typed mapping between documents and C# class types with generics
* Generic Repository with support for LINQ queries against objects and their children (where the DocumentDB client supports it)
* Limited cross-document transactional support
* Limited Partitioned Collection Support (partition on Id or ClassName)
* In-memory database, and event history for testing
* Profiling (e.g. Duration and Query Cost in Request Units)
* Automatic Id and timestamp management of object hierarchies 
* Automatic retries of queries when limits are exceeded

DataStore is built with .NET Core SDK v.1.0.0-preview4-004771 +(VS2017 RC4.262228.4.0) but  is backwards compatible with the .NET Framework 4.5.2 platform and does not require .NET Core.","DocumentDb,Azure,Data,Access,Transactions,Profiling,LINQ",5743,False,3.5.2
