Modules: biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging

d-fens GmbH, General-Guisan-Strasse 6, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland

This PowerShell module contains Cmdlets that allow to perform logging from your PowerShell functions and code via the Apache Log4Net library.

* You can also download this module via [NuGet](http://nuget.org) with [Install-Package biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging/). 

* After downloading the package to a directory of your choice (_NOT_ the actual module directory) run the `install.ps1` script in the downloaded folder to copy the files to a directory inside `$ENV:PSModulePath`).

* In case you already have a previous version of this module ( < 1.0.5) in a different module directory you have to remove that module manually.

* In case you update the module in the same directory and the `log4net.dll` is still loaded you might have to restart all the PowerShell sessions to be able to overwrite the file.

* In case you changed the log settings in `biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging.xml`, `Log4netConfiguration.xml` or `log4net.xml` you have to restore the changes as they will get overwritten.

See http://d-fens.ch/2013/01/16/module-biz-dfch-ps-system-logging/ and the [Wiki](https://github.com/dfch/biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging/wiki) for more information.",biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging,False,2016-07-15T00:45:42.837-07:00,True,False,This PowerShell module provides Cmdlets to perform logging from your PowerShell script via log4net to arbitrary log format.

DevForce fills this gap so you don't have to. Instead of building, maintaining, revising, and defending your application's infrastructure; you can focus on what you do best-application development.

DevForce implements end-to-end n-tier architecture by exposing a generic web service on the server that takes a LINQ expression and returns business objects to the client over the internet.

Write LINQ queries on the client and get back business objects with your own custom business logic-just like working with a 2-tier or client-server application.
